# Mockup to Portfolio

## About the Project

In this first project for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree, I was given a mockup PDF file and was tasked with
converting it into a live portfolio that I can personalize and add to as I have progressed in the Nanodegree. 

## Project Details

I designed the portfolio responsively using flexbox and media queries. I also added modal functionality inspired by Twitter's
Bootstrap.
